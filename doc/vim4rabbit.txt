1. Introduction                                        *vim4rabbit-introduction*

vim4rabbit is a Vim plugin with a Python backend that integrates CodeRabbit
AI code review directly into Vim. It supports reviewing uncommitted, committed,
or all changes, displays results with collapsible folds, and optionally sends
selected issues to Claude Code for AI-powered fixes.

Mini-games are available to play while waiting for review results.
